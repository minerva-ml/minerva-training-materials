    "# Welcome to Minerva Whales problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Whale recognition\n",
    "In this problem we will reproduce the winning solution to the [Right Whale Recognition challenge from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition). \n",
    "\n",
    "# The Solution\n",
    "Solution has 3 stages or subproblems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Whale head localization**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to find coordinates of the bounding box with the whale head inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"static/localizer_example.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Whale head keypoint detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to find coordinates of blowtip and blowhead on whale head. They are needed for head alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"static/aligner_example.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Whale recognition** \n",
    "\n",
    "The original task of whale ID or name classification. All the steps that come before this one are meant to normalize the input and make it easier for the neural network.\n",

    "- How to work with Pytorch framework\n",
    "- How to build a deep neural network\n",
    "- How optimization hyperparameters interact with each other and how to tweak them\n",
    "- How to use augmentation and you will build your own custom pytorch data loader\n",

    "# How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a task, for example `task1.ipynb`. Write your implementation to the task by filling `CONFIG` dictionary or the body of the `solution` function according to the instructions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CONFIG = {}\n",
    "def solution():\n",
    "    return something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can submit your solution with 3 types of Neptune support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Neptune\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose this option if you want to work without Neptune support.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download data (once):  \n",
    "    - Download file `imgs.zip` from [Right Whale Recognition challenge site on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition/data) (you must be logged in to kaggle to do that).\n",
    "    - Extract `imgs.zip` to `resources/whales/data/`.\n",
    "    - After that, folder `resources/whales/data/` should contain two elements: file `metadata.csv` and folder `imgs` with images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In `neptune.yaml` file:\n",
    "    - Comment `pip-requirements-file` line.\n",
    "    - Uncomment Local setup paths and set them as follows:\n",
    "      - `data_dir`: `resources/whales/data/`,\n",
    "      - `solution_dir`: `resources/whales/solution/`.\n",
    "    - Comment Cloud setup paths.\n",
    "3. Type:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python main.py -- submit --problem whales --task_nr 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neptune locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose this option if you want to run the pipeline locally and use Neptune to visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download data in the same way as for no Neptune support.\n",
    "2. Edit `neptune.yaml` file in the same way as for no Neptune support.\n",
    "3. Type:\n",
    "    #### For whales problem:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    neptune run -- submit --problem whales --task_nr 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neptune's cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose this option if you want to run the pipeline on the cloud available through Neptune.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `neptune.yaml` file:\n",
    "    - Uncomment `pip-requirements-file` line.\n",
    "    - Comment Local setup paths.\n",
    "    - Uncomment Cloud setup paths and set them as follows:\n",
    "      - `data_dir`: `/public/whales`,\n",
    "      - `solution_dir`: `/public/minerva/resources/whales/solution`.\n",
    "2. Type:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    neptune send \\\n",
    "    --environment pytorch-0.2.0-gpu-py3 \\\n",
    "    --worker gcp-gpu-medium \\\n",
    "    -- submit --problem whales --task_nr 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "Check [User Guide](https://github.com/neptune-ml/minerva/wiki/User-Guide) for more options, for example the dry mode allowing you to quickly check if everything works fine."
