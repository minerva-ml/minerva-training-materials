    "In this problem we will reproduce the winning solution to the [Right Whale Recognition challenge from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition). \n",

    "# The Solution\n",
    "Solution has 3 stages or subproblems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Whale head localization**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to find coordinates of the bounding box with the whale head inside.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Whale head keypoint detection**\n",

    "You need to find coordinates of blowtip and blowhead on whale head. They are needed for head alignment.\n",

    "* **Whale recognition** \n",
    "\n",
    "The original task of whale ID or name classification. All the steps that come before this one are meant to normalize the input and make it easier for the neural network.\n",

    "# How it works\n",
    "## Dry run mode\n",
    "In dry run mode you can run our pipeline to make sure that everything is working correctly.\n",
    "1. If you work without Neptune:\n",
    "  1. In `config.yaml` file:\n",
    "    - uncomment Local setup paths,\n",
    "    - `data_dir` path doesn't matter in fashion_mnist problem,\n",
    "    - set `solution_dir` local path in a way you like, e.g. `output/path_to_your_solution`,\n",
    "    - comment Cloud setup paths,\n",
    "    - comment `pip-requirements-file` line.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python run_minerva.py -- dry_run --problem fashion_mnist\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. If you want to run our pipeline locally and use Neptune to visualize the results:\n",
    "  1. Edit `config.yaml` file in the same way like in point 1.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune run run_minerva.py --config config.yaml -- dry_run \\\n",
    "--problem fashion_mnist\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. If you want to run our pipeline on the cloud available through Neptune:\n",
    "  1. In `config.yaml` file:\n",
    "    - comment Local setup paths,\n",
    "    - uncomment Cloud setup paths,\n",
    "    - `data_dir` path doesn't matter in fashion_mnist problem,\n",
    "    - set `solution_dir` local path in a way you like, but with `/output` in the beginning, e.g.  `/output/path_to_your_solution`,\n",
    "    - uncomment `pip-requirements-file` line.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune send run_minerva.py \\\n",
    "--environment keras-2.0-gpu-py3 \\\n",
    "--worker gcp-gpu-medium \\\n",
    "--config config.yaml \\\n",
    "-- dry_run --problem fashion_mnist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submit mode\n",
    "Submit mode is the main Minerva mode where you exchange one step from our pipeline with your own solution and submit it.\n",
    "### Writing your own solution\n",
    "Choose a task, for example `task1.ipynb`. Write your implementation to the task by filling CONFIG dictionary and the body of the solution function according to the instructions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CONFIG = {}\n",
    "def solution():\n",
    "    return something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submiting\n",
    "Submit your solution by running one of three options:\n",
    "1. Without Neptune:\n",
    "  1. Edit `config.yaml` file in the same way like in the dry run mode.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python run_minerva.py -- submit --problem fashion_mnist --task_nr 1 \\\n",
    "--filepath resources/fashion_mnist/problems/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Locally with Neptune monitoring:\n",
    "  1. Edit `config.yaml` file in the same way like in the dry run mode.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune run run_minerva.py --config config.yaml -- submit \\\n",
    "--problem fashion_mnist --task_nr 1 \\\n",
    "--filepath resources/fashion_mnist/problems/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. On Neptune's cloud:\n",
    "  1. Edit `config.yaml` file in the same way like in the dry run mode.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune send run_minerva.py \\\n",
    "--environment keras-2.0-gpu-py3 \\\n",
    "--worker gcp-gpu-medium \\\n",
    "--config config.yaml \\\n",
    "-- submit --problem fashion_mnist --task_nr 1 \\\n",
    "--filepath resources/fashion_mnist/problems/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then wait for the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working in the cloud with neptune\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to `config.yaml` and specify path to data and solution.\n",
    "For example if you wanted to solve the head localization task you would change it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    parameters:\n",
    "      data_dir: /public/whales\n",
    "      solution_dir: /public/minerva/whales/localization\n",
    "```\n",

    "Problems are in the `resources/whales/problems` folder. If you want you can copy it to any other location and develop there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start solving tasks in the notebooks. \n",
    "Work on your `solution` function and `CONFIG` specs. \n",
    "For example if you are done developing task1 simply go\n",
    "\n",

    "## Working locally\n",
    "Install the requirements as explained in the README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to download the whale data from:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition/data\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important is the imgs directory. \n",
    "Create project data folder for instance `my_data_folder`.\n",
    "Extract `imgs.zip` directory to `my_data_folder` and copy metadata from `resources/whales/data/metadata.csv` to that folder as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Neptune Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to https://neptune.ml/ and create your account (you will get $100 in computational resources for the effort). Create a project named minerva with key MIN.\n",
    "install neptune-cli by going:\n",
