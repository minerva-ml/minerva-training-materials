    "# Fashion Mnist Problem\n",
    "In this teaser we will focus on fashion mnist benchmark dataset. This dataset is a collection of 28x28 greyscale images of clothes that belong to 10 classes. The dataset looks like this:\n",

    "# You will learn\n",
    "- How to work with Keras framework\n",
    "- How to build a deep neural network\n",
    "- How optimization hyperparameters interact with each other and how to tweak them\n",
    "- How to use augmentation and you will build your own keras image generator\n",

    "# How it works\n",
    "## Dry run mode\n",
    "In dry run mode you can run our pipeline to make sure that everything is working correctly.\n",
    "1. If you work without Neptune:\n",
    "  1. In `config.yaml` file:\n",
    "    - uncomment Local setup paths,\n",
    "    - `data_dir` path doesn't matter in fashion_mnist problem,\n",
    "    - set `solution_dir` local path in a way you like, e.g. `output/path_to_your_solution`,\n",
    "    - comment Cloud setup paths,\n",
    "    - comment `pip-requirements-file` line.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python run_minerva.py -- dry_run --problem fashion_mnist\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. If you want to run our pipeline locally and use Neptune to visualize the results:\n",
    "  1. Edit `config.yaml` file in the same way like in point 1.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune run run_minerva.py --config config.yaml -- dry_run \\\n",
    "--problem fashion_mnist\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. If you want to run our pipeline on the cloud available through Neptune:\n",
    "  1. In `config.yaml` file:\n",
    "    - comment Local setup paths,\n",
    "    - uncomment Cloud setup paths,\n",
    "    - `data_dir` path doesn't matter in fashion_mnist problem,\n",
    "    - set `solution_dir` local path in a way you like, but with `/output` in the beginning, e.g.  `/output/path_to_your_solution`,\n",
    "    - uncomment `pip-requirements-file` line.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune send run_minerva.py \\\n",
    "--environment keras-2.0-gpu-py3 \\\n",
    "--worker gcp-gpu-medium \\\n",
    "--config config.yaml \\\n",
    "-- dry_run --problem fashion_mnist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submit mode\n",
    "Submit mode is the main Minerva mode where you exchange one step from our pipeline with your own solution and submit it.\n",
    "### Writing your own solution\n",
    "Choose a task, for example `task1.ipynb`. Write your implementation to the task by filling CONFIG dictionary and the body of the solution function according to the instructions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "CONFIG = {}\n",
    "def solution():\n",
    "    return something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submiting\n",
    "Submit your solution by running one of three options:\n",
    "1. Without Neptune:\n",
    "  1. Edit `config.yaml` file in the same way like in the dry run mode.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python run_minerva.py -- submit --problem fashion_mnist --task_nr 1 \\\n",
    "--filepath resources/fashion_mnist/problems/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Locally with Neptune monitoring:\n",
    "  1. Edit `config.yaml` file in the same way like in the dry run mode.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune run run_minerva.py --config config.yaml -- submit \\\n",
    "--problem fashion_mnist --task_nr 1 \\\n",
    "--filepath resources/fashion_mnist/problems/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. On Neptune's cloud:\n",
    "  1. Edit `config.yaml` file in the same way like in the dry run mode.\n",
    "  2. Type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "neptune send run_minerva.py \\\n",
    "--environment keras-2.0-gpu-py3 \\\n",
    "--worker gcp-gpu-medium \\\n",
    "--config config.yaml \\\n",
    "-- submit --problem fashion_mnist --task_nr 1 \\\n",
    "--filepath resources/fashion_mnist/problems/task1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then wait for the results."
