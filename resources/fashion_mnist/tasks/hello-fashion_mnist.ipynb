    "Choose a task, for example `task1.ipynb`. Write your implementation to the task by filling `CONFIG` dictionary or the body of the `solution` function according to the instructions:\n",

    "CONFIG = {}\n",
    "def solution():\n",

    "You can submit your solution with 3 types of Neptune support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Neptune\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose this option if you want to work without Neptune support.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `neptune.yaml` file:\n",
    "    - Comment `pip-requirements-file` line.\n",
    "    - Uncomment Local setup paths and set them as follows:\n",
    "      - `data_dir`: doesn't matter,\n",
    "      - `solution_dir`: `resources/fashion_mnist/solution`.\n",
    "    - Comment Cloud setup paths.\n",
    "2. Type:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python main.py -- submit --problem fashion_mnist --task_nr 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neptune locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose this option if you want to run the pipeline locally and use Neptune to visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit `neptune.yaml` file in the same way as for no Neptune support.\n",
    "2. Type:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    neptune run -- submit --problem fashion_mnist --task_nr 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neptune's cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose this option if you want to run the pipeline on the cloud available through Neptune.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `neptune.yaml` file:\n",
    "    - Uncomment `pip-requirements-file` line.\n",
    "    - Comment Local setup paths.\n",
